# Robot-Navigation-System
This is a project I have done for the Data Structures course in my university education.

It is a system that allowed the robot to navigate any chessboard till he finds a goal.
The robot can do operations, such as finding the goal in any chessboard by DFS using stack and BFS using a queue, building all potential paths from starting point leading to the GOAL using tree representing in the chessboard, sorting all the valid paths to the GOAL using sorting algorithms.
The system has been developed with the java language.
